pattern_gen_CA
______________

almost same as pattern_gen, but there's a "life game" button.
life game will start from the pattern, one click is one generation.
'L' key is also available for game of life function.

"range" in the GUI controls threshold of survive or death due to depopulationã€€or congestion.
default is 2 and 3.

"birth" is the number of neighbours when the cell become alive.
but in the code, when neighbours's number is 3, always become alive.
so this parameter is additional.

so default is 23/3

if you move "range" 1 to 3, set 6 to "birth", it will be 13/36.

recommended numbers are 47/36, 47/37 and 12/34.
